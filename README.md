## ES6 and JS Unit Tests Project

### About
This is a project from [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)'s Web Development Course - Principles of Web Development Module.

Unit tests are essential for creating quality features. Learning what they are and how they should be implemented is essential for software developers.
In this project, I made the implementation of various functions to meet the proposed requirements and/or unit tests to ensure that the implementations of the functions are correct.

### Developed Skills

- Writing unit tests for functions using the NodeJS Jest module to verify these functions;
- From already implemented tests, writing functions so that they meet the proposed tests;
- Writing tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.
